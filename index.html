        <h1>A Right to Knowledge</h1>
        <p>All sorts of literature and media are banned worldwide, and I believe that taking away access to information and art violates a human right, the right to knowledge. Everyone should be able to view what they want to, regardless of the country or administration's policies. In many cases, banning can be a little irrational, or even deliberate ignorance when a government bans something based on fear that there may be dissent among their citizens. So, join my cause. Fight against institutions and governments to take back our right to knowledge!</p>
        <h2>Why are they banned?</h2>
        <p>Why do literature and media get banned? Well, most reasons are because of indecent, profane, or just obscene content. A book such as Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" is banned because of the heavy language in the book. A lot of viewers and parents alike said that the use of the N-word, or topics of discussion such as rape wasn't something people should teach, even at a high school level. For the media, South Park is a very challenging show for its political comedy and social satire. Sexual and racial themes are a pretty hot topic and tend to be banned a lot for either religious reasons or to keep it out of the youth's hands.></p>
        <h2>Who is behind all of this? </h2>
        <p>Schools, governments, religious institutions, and other administrations like libraries or shops can either straight up ban things or just remove them from their shelves. Schools, especially in America, are very known for banning countless books based off the reasons stated in the last paragraph. Around 4,120 books have been banned across America in just 2024. Government bannings are usually tied to the government's ideologies or if the church is a heavy aspect of the government, in which those cases they are noted as "blasphemous". In the past, authoritarian governments ban books and media if it could cause public dissent, as said above. "1984", by George Orwell, is a great example of this. In South Korea, a current authoritarian government, 1984 is banned. In the book, it follows a character in a society governed by a totalitarian government. The character ends up joining a revolution and fights against his country. Governments with some of the same qualities may not want it to be shown to the public, as it may cause a revolution if they end up drawing similarities.</p>
