        <h2>To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <p>“To Kill a Mockingbird” is a very well-known novel that tackles racism and injustice in America during the Jim Crow era. The story is told from the eyes of two children, Scout, and Jem Finch, and their father is a lawyer who is defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Because of this, the family is harassed by their community. While not historically accurate, it is based on a similar case near the author's hometown. However the prejudice towards black people was much more severe than what was shown in the book, and I believe that history should be taught, but some parents and teachers don’t believe so. To Kill a Mockingbird is now a very widely banned book throughout a majority of American schools for its use of the N-word and discussions of sexual violence. Parents say the reason it must be banned is because of its language, and it could perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Students claim that they feel uncomfortable when reading it in a classroom setting, but I believe that is a reason why it should be “taught”. It is best to learn about American history to its darkest corners, and taking away a book such as this is taking away difficult conversations about racism and injustice that create awareness and understanding. No matter how hard the truth may sound, keeping students away from it is robbing them of the opportunity to learn about history in a meaningful way. While I understand the intentions of those banning it, avoiding these topics does more harm than good by failing to prepare students for the real world. Instead of banning it, schools should use it as a tool to spark critical discussions about race, justice, and empathy.

        <h2>1984, by George Orwell</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>“1984”, is a dystopian novel set in 1984, in Oceania, one of the three totalitarian states of the time. This book was written in 1949, and the author believed that this may be an incoming future. The story follows Winston Smith, a worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly despises the Party and dreams of rebellion. He decided to join a resistance group along with his colleague Julia and goes against the ideologies and the laws of the state. 1984 has been banned in many countries, particularly in authoritarian regimes like North Korea. In North Korea, where information is tightly controlled, books like 1984 are seen as dangerous threats to the government and could lead to a revolt among its citizens. I believe people should never be under a controlling government, and 1984 can allow the citizens to draw comparisons and allow them more free reign over their freedoms as human citizens, with their right to knowledge

        <h2>Harry Potter, by J. K. Rowling</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>“Harry Potter”, one of the world's most popular book series, is banned for religious reasons in some schools throughout the U.S. It follows the story of Harry Potter, an 11-year-old boy who soon finds out he possesses the ability to do magic, and in turn is invited to attend “Hogwarts, the school for Witchcraft and Wizardry”. While millions of kids have been enchanted by its magical world, religious groups and schools have often targeted the series for its themes of witchcraft. A pastor in Tennessee once claimed that the spells in the books were “real” and could summon evil spirits, and accusations that the book represented a religion called Wicca. Wicca is a pagan religion and is a syncretic, earth-centered religion, but to some people, it is shown as Satanic or Anti-Christian. Parents have also voiced concerns, saying the books encourage rebellion against family and authority figures, especially with Harry’s rocky relationship with his adoptive family, the Dursleys. While these concerns may come from a place of wanting to protect kids, banning Harry Potter undermines its value. The series inspires imagination and creativity while teaching important values like bravery, friendship, and perseverance. It also explores deeper themes, such as prejudice and self-identity, in ways that resonate with young readers. Even if it has an Anti-religious theme, parents and teachers should allow their kids or students to have access to a wide range of ideas, as taking away those ideas can limit their education and curiosity. In other countries, this could be said in the same way. Even if books show ideas that are radically or somewhat different from the religious values set in place, removing access to such books limits the discussion of other beliefs, and can also help foster a better understanding of other religions and ultimately promote tolerance and empathy within society.
